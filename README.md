# Walmart Sales Analysis using Power BI

This repository contains the Power BI files and a brief overview of the Walmart sales analysis project.

## Overview

This project involved analyzing historical sales data from Walmart to gain insights into various aspects of their business performance. The analysis aimed to identify key trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales across different stores, departments, and time periods. Power BI was used as the primary tool for data visualization and interactive reporting.

## Key Objectives of the Analysis

* **Sales Performance:** Understanding overall sales trends and growth over time.
* **Store Performance:** Identifying top-performing and underperforming stores.
* **Department Performance:** Analyzing sales contribution and trends for different product departments.
* **Impact of Events:** Evaluating the effect of holidays and promotional events on sales.
* **Forecasting:** Predicting future sales based on historical data. (Note: Forecasting might be a future step or included in the Power BI file)
* **Identifying Key Drivers:** Determining factors that significantly influence sales.

## Datasets Used

The analysis was performed using Walmart sales data, which typically includes information such as:

* Store ID
* Date
* Department
* Weekly Sales
* Holiday Flag (indicating if the week included a holiday)
* Temperature
* Fuel Price
* CPI (Consumer Price Index)
* Unemployment Rate

(Note: The specific columns available in the dataset might vary.)

## Power BI Files

This repository includes the following Power BI files:

* **Walmart Sales Analysis.pbix:** The main Power BI Desktop file containing the data model, visualizations, and reports.

## Key Insights and Visualizations (Examples)

The Power BI report includes interactive dashboards and visualizations such as:

* **Overall Sales Dashboard:** Displays total sales, sales growth, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
* **Store Performance Dashboard:** Shows sales performance by store, ranking of stores based on sales, and comparisons across different stores.
* **Department Performance Dashboard:** Visualizes sales by department, highlighting top-selling departments and their trends.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Line charts showing sales trends over time, with the ability to filter by store and department.
* **Holiday Impact Analysis:** Comparison of sales during holiday weeks versus non-holiday weeks.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Scatter plots or other visualizations to explore the relationship between sales and factors like temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate.



## Potential Future Enhancements

* **Advanced Forecasting Models:** Implementing more sophisticated forecasting techniques to predict future sales with greater accuracy.
* **Market Basket Analysis:** Identifying associations between different products purchased together.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing sales data to identify different customer segments and their purchasing behavior (requires customer-level data).
* **Integration with Other Data Sources:** Combining sales data with other relevant information, such as marketing campaign data or weather forecasts, for a more comprehensive analysis.
* **Interactive What-If Analysis:** Incorporating parameters to allow users to perform what-if scenarios and understand the potential impact of different factors on sales.
